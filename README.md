# Walk to Reveal-Android Game
Walk to Reveal is an Android game that provides a unique experience of exploring a map. The game is designed to challenge the players to reveal different parts of the map by walking on the streets. The blurred-out map and unblurring paths create a sense of adventure and excitement.

## Motivation: 
The motivation behind creating this game is to provide a unique and enjoyable experience for the players. We wanted to develop a game that encourages the players to explore their surroundings while having fun. The idea of walking to reveal the map came from the desire to create a game that promotes physical activity while providing entertainment.


## Illustrations and Demo:
I am planning to include a simple demo illustration soon. 

## Tools Used
The following tools will be used to develop the Walk to Reveal game:
* Java - I will use Java to develop the game logic and implement the gameplay mechanics.
* Android SDK - The Android SDK will be used to develop the game for Android devices.
* Google Maps API - I will use the Google Maps API to display the map and track the player's location.
* Gradle - I will use Gradle to manage dependencies and build the game.

## Project Status
The Walk to Reveal game is still under review and planning phase. I am currently working on the game design and mechanics. I will keep updating the repository with my progress, and we hope to release the game soon.
